This tutorial is for measuring predictability of time series data with  
We will use hourly power demand data for a country defined as MWH per capit  as an example.


Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib  and ../unsupv directory from avenir python directory with all the python 
files wrt where power.py is. Feel free to change configuration in profod.properties according to your needs.

Generate input data
===================
python power.py gen <num_days_in_past> > pwuse.txt

where
num_days_in_past = number of days in past e.g 370

Split into training and validation data
=======================================
Most recent 5 days data will be used for validation and the rest for training.

validation data
tail -120 pwuse.txt > puvalidate.txt
Set path in forecast.validate.file

training data
head -n 8785  pwuse.txt > putrain.txt
Set path in train.data.file


Train model
===========
python profod.py profod.properties common.mode=train

If the parameter is set in profod.properties, you don't need to provide it as the last argument
Make sure the following parametrs are set appropriately in profod.properties, so that model is saved

common.model.directory=model
common.model.file=proph_model 
train.model.save=True
train.data.file=putrain.txt
train.data.fields=0,1
train.data.new.dateformat=%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

Validate model
==============
python profod.py profod.properties common.mode=validate

Make sure the following parametrs are set appropriately in profod.properties

forecast.use.saved.model=_  (default True)
forecast.window=120
forecast.unit=H
forecast.include.history=False
forecast.validate.file=puvalidate.txt

At the end of the consolr output, you will see SSE

Block Shuffle data
==================
python profod.py profod.properties common.mode=shuffle

Make sure the following parametrs are set appropriately in profod.properties

predictability.input.file=pwuse.txt
predictability.block.size=4
predictability.shuffled.file=sh_pwuse.txt

Split shuffled data into training and validation data
=====================================================
validation data
tail -120 sh_pwuse.txt > sh_puvalidate.txt
Set path in forecast.validate.file

training data
head -n 8785  sh_pwuse.txt > sh_putrain.txt

Set path in 
train.data.file=sh_putrain.txt

Train model with shuffled data
==============================
python profod.py profod.properties common.mode=train

Validate model with shuffled data
=================================
Set path as
forecast.validate.file=sh_puvalidate.txt

python profod.py profod.properties common.mode=validate

At the end of the consolr output, you will see SSE for shuffled data. 

Predictability
==============
Predictability = min(0, 1.0 - normal data SSE / shuffled data SSE)

Randomize data
==============
python profod.py profod.properties common.mode=randomize

Make sure the following parametrs are set appropriately in profod.properties
rand.input.file=pwuse.txt
rand.shuffled.file=rpwuse.txt

Split into training and validation data
=======================================
Most recent 5 days data will be used for validation and the rest for training.

validation data
tail -120 rpwuse.txt > rpuvalidate.txt
Set path in forecast.validate.file

training data
head -n 8785  rpwuse.txt > rputrain.txt
Set path in train.data.file

Train model
===========
As before. Set the following parameter

train.data.file=rputrain.txt

Validate model
==============
As before. Set the following parameter

forecast.validate.file=rpuvalidate.txt

Block Shuffle data
==================
As before. Set the following parameter

predictability.shuffled.file=sh_rpwuse.txt

Split shuffled data into training and validation data
=====================================================
validation data
tail -120 sh_rpwuse.txt > sh_rpuvalidate.txt
Set path in forecast.validate.file

training data
head -n 8785  sh_rpwuse.txt > sh_rputrain.txt

Set path in 
train.data.file=sh_putrain.txt

Train model
===========
As before. Set the following parameter

train.data.file=sh_rputrain.txt

Validate model
==============
As before. Set the following parameter

forecast.validate.file=sh_rpuvalidate.txt

Predictability
==============
As before

Compare predictability
======================
Compare predictability between normal data and randomized data
