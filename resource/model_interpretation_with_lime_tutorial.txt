This tutorial is for model interpretation with Lime and ScikitLearn. The 3 classifiers supported  are SVM, 
Random Foest and Gradient Boosted Trees. Lime will tell the the most influential features for the chosen record.
The use case is for predicting mortagage loan approval. In this tutorial we will use Random Forest

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib and ../text directories with all the python files wrt where loan_approve.py
is.  Since your python installation may  be different, please run all python scripts starting with 
python abc.py ...

Create training data
====================
./loan_approve.py genTwo <num_loans> <error> <key_len> > loan.txt

where
num_loans = number of loans e.g. 5000
error = error rate in generated data e.g 0.1
key_len = record key length e.g. 10

Encode categorical features
===========================
./loan_approve.py encLabel  <num_loans>  loan.txt > loan_5000.txt 

Make sure the the following is set in loan_rf.properties
train.data.file=loan_5000.txt

Train and validate classifier
=============================
./intrd.py trainValidate rf loan_rf.properties

The file loan_rf.properties contains all the configuration parameters for Random Forest.Change classifier 
parameter values in loan_rf.properties and keep repeating until you get test error within reasonable bounds.

The other option is to use autoML for parameter tuning. Please refer to the tutorial automl_with_scikit_hyperopt_tutorial.txt

Train and save classifier
=========================
./intrd.py train rf loan_rf.properties

Make sure the parameters in loan_rf.properties are set to the optimum values found in previous step
Make sure the following is set loan_rf.properties
train.model.save=True
Make sure the directory defined by the following exists. You are free to change the directory
common.model.directory=model/loan

Explain model
=============
./intrd.py explain rf loan_rf.properties loan_intr.properties <rec>

where 
The file loan_intr.properties contains all the configuration parameters for  Lime explainer.
rec = a record from loan_5000.txt without the first and last column, where the last column value is 1

In the output you will see the explainer output
