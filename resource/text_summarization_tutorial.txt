This tutorial is for text summarization with  6 text extraction algorithms

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib and ../text directories with all the python files wrt where summd.py
is. The driver code is in summd.py. Each algorithm configuration is contained in in it's own properties. 
Since your python installation is likely to be different, please run all python scripts starting with 
python abc.py ...

Execution
=========
Run the different algorithms as follows. You can set the number of sentences desired in the properties
file. The parameter common.data.file  should be set to the path of the file you want to summarize.
The parameter common.size should be set to the number of sentences you want in the summary. 
You can also set loggig related parameters in the properties file. There are algorithm specific 
parameters. If you are familiar with the algorithms, you can can change them from the defaiult values.
