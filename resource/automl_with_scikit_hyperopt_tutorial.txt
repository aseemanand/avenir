This tutorial is for autoML with Hyperopt and Scikit learn. The 3 classifiers used are SVM, Random Foest and
Gradient Boosted Trees. The Hypoeropt optimizer will tell the the best algorith and the assiciated parameters.
The use case is for predicting escalation for a customer service ticketing syste.

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib and ../text directories with all the python files wrt where autosupv.py
is. The onfiguration for the 3 classifiers are es_svm.properties, esc_rf.properties  and esc_gbt.properties.
Since your python installation may  be different, please run all python scripts starting with 
python abc.py ...

Create training data file
=========================
./cs_escalate.py generate <num_records> <noise> <key_len> > <training_data_file_path>

num_records = number of records e.g 5000
noise = added noise in the data e.g. .05
key_len = length of unique key
training_data_file_path = training data file path

Set train.data.file in all 3 properties file with the training data file path

Test all the classifiers independently
======================================
Make sure you have this setting in all 3 properties file
common.mode=trainValidate

Train and validate each classifier
./svmd.py esc_svm.properties
./rfd.py esc_rf.properties
./gb.py esc_gbt.properties

Search space
============
I have used a small search space. You can expand it by adding parameters to train.search.params
and then defining the range of values for the parameters added using the the current search parameters as 
examples

Run Hyperopt
============
./autosupv.py <num_iter> svm:esc_svm.properties rf:esc_rf.properties gbt:esc_gbt.properties
num_iter = number of iteration  e.g 100

At the end of the output you will see the best classifiers along with parameters.
