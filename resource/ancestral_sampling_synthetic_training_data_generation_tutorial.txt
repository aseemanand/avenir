This tutorial is for generating synthetic training  data for machine learning classification 
problems using ancestral sampling. Specifically we will use generate training data for heart 
disease prediction.


Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib  directory with all the python files wrt where heart_disease.py
is. 

Generate data
=============
./heart_disease.py generate <num_samples> <noise_level> <key_len> > <output_file>

num_samples = number of samples e.g 5000
noise_level = noise level e.g. 0.1
key_len = unique key length (otional)
output_file = output file

If key_len parameter is provided, then unique key of specified is pre pended to each generated
record.

Other classification problem
============================
If you want to generate data for another classification problem, you will need to replace the 
code from line 42 to 123 containing the distribution definitions yiu need for your problem.
